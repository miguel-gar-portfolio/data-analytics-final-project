This work covers several fields in data analytics as it takes on downloading data from a link
in a website using ETL tools and storing this information in a database via ETL procedures.
Once data has been stored properly, SQL queries are used for extracting pertinent
information in order to answer some questions. Eventually, Power BIâ€™s dashboards allow us
to collect insights from this massive data set and support decision making for executive
teams.
